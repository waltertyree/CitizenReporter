README for CitizenReporter for TapLynx plugin

The idea for CitizenReporter came at the end of 2009 and our
first version of the plugin is outlined in this blog post

http://blog.tyreeapps.com/2010/01/citizen-reporter-plug-in-for-taplynx.html

As with any programming project, we've gotten better so
the code needs to be reworked every few months.

Installation:
1) Add the CitizenReporterViewController.h/.m/.sib files to your TapLynx project
2) Update your NGConfig using the values of the sample.plist file as an example
3) Modify the look and feel of the CitizenReporterViewController.xib in the Interface Builder as you want.

As always, please submit feedback and suggestions to info@tyreeapps.com
