README for CitizenReporter for TapLynx plugin

The idea for CitizenReporter came at the end of 2009 and our
first version of the plugin is outlined in this blog post

http://blog.tyreeapps.com/2010/01/citizen-reporter-plug-in-for-taplynx.html

As with any programming project, we've gotten better so
the code needs to be reworked every few months.

TODO:
let people configure the plugin via the NGConfig.plst
stub out posting data to a webpage rather than with email
